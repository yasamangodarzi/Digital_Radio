# Digital_Radio
Analog radios that exist today are actually a receiver of surrounding signals and with the help of electrical components,
they act as a pass filter and transmit the filtered signal with a shift in the frequency domain to the hearing range of the human ear.
In this project, an input is given which are actually the same signals in the air,
and the program must broadcast the desired radio network by getting the desired frequency like a radio.
#Project Description 
The input file is 10 seconds of the signal received by the antenna with a sampling rate of 480KHz. The input file is a text file with one number of input signal numbers in each line. At first, the program reads the input file and waits for a number that is the frequency of the radio network intended by the user, and then passes the input signal through a low-pass filter with the pass frequency entered by the user, then transfers the signal to the hearing range. It brings the human ear and finally plays the formed sound and waits for the arrival of a new number of users
